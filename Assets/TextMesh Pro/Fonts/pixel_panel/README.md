## About

The Pixel Panel font is a 6x10 bitmap-inspired font featuring two variable axes: One that controls the pixel size, and another one that controls the pixel roundness.

Born from the struggle of finding the perfect font during the modeling of real-world items, the Pixel Panel font emerged as a solution that marries classic appeal with adaptability, making it the go-to choice for a variety of applications.
